## Submitting Code

We welcome everyone to contribute to DroidGit! If you'd like your code to be considered for merging, please take a moment to review our requirements:

* Your contributions must be your own original work or modifications, and you must agree to the terms of our [Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/Olsc/DroidGit).
* Please try to follow the existing code style and naming conventions used throughout the project.
* Aim to write "clean code" — avoid overly long functions and classes. When adding new features, consider creating new classes instead of adding large amounts of code to existing ones.
* Except for minor bug fixes, submitted code will generally be reviewed, and feedback may be provided. Before merging into the master branch, some adjustments may be requested based on the review.
* Please submit your changes via GitHub's Pull Request feature.

## Help with Translations (Localization)

DroidGit supports multiple languages so that users can interact with it in their preferred language — provided translations are available.

If you'd like to help with translations, you can start by checking the [translation requests](https://github.com/Olsc/DroidGit/issues) here.

Contributing translations is straightforward: just submit a Pull Request modifying the relevant language resource files in the project.

## Reporting Issues or Suggestions

If you've found a bug or have an idea for improvement, feel free to open an issue!

Before submitting, we recommend searching through [previous issues](https://github.com/Olsc/DroidGit/issues?q=is%3Aissue) to see if it has already been reported or resolved.

When reporting a bug, please include log files — they help us diagnose problems much faster. You can obtain logs using Android Studio's Logcat or the ADB tool, which provide detailed information about the app's behavior.

If you're unsure how to do this, just let us know in the issue, and we'll be happy to help.
